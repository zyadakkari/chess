# *TOP RUBY: Chess*

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-ruby-final-project

Implementation of a chess game.

Currently the game works aside from a slight bug in piece moves in check. The main goal now is to refactor the code in line with OOP principles as the code is now too dependent on conditionals and also has several DRY violations.

This project was a significant challenge and stretched my ability to really break down a problem into component parts. I am pleased with my ability to break the problem down into each piece, however during the planning phase it would have paid dividends to spend some time thinking laterally about the shared problem by each piece. This would have allowed the development of many of the solutions in tandem as opposed to separate implementations which now need to be unified.

My goal is to refactor the code and then work on developing the AI player - with a target of an AI that can optimise to a depth of 3 moves.
